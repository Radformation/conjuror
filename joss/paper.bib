abstract = {The charges on this task group (TG) were as follows: (a) provide specific procedural guidelines for performing the tests recommended in TG 142; (b) provide estimate of the range of time, appropriate personnel, and qualifications necessary to complete the tests in TG 142; and (c) provide sample daily, weekly, monthly, or annual quality assurance (QA) forms. Many of the guidelines in this report are drawn from the literature and are included in the references. When literature was not available, specific test methods reflect the experiences of the TG members (e.g., a test method for door interlock is self-evident with no literature necessary). In other cases, the technology is so new that no literature for test methods was available. Given broad clinical adaptation of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), which is not a specific topic of TG 142, several tests and criteria specific to VMAT were added.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this document is to provide the qualified medical physicist (QMP) with guidance on the critical evaluation and independent validation of “closed” or “black box” systems in a radiation oncology setting. Radiotherapy delivery systems and their associated subsystems are highly sophisticated and complicated. In recent years, vendors have worked closely with QMPs, information technology (IT) personnel, and clinical engineers to develop and ultimately provide an entire package of resources at the time of purchase of radiotherapy delivery equipment. Commissioning and routine quality assurance (QA) on these new, black-box systems is not necessarily more difficult or time-consuming; however, there are different factors to consider with black-boxes. Independence in the vendor's own validation techniques now becomes critical to establish. For vendor-provided tools, the user must understand the implications of working with a service tool or a true QA tool. Lastly, the user must determine which components of the system are unknown and differ from a classic white-box system. Understanding these characteristics of the black-box will guide the user in determining which quality management (QM) tools are applicable and which verification and validation (V\&V) procedures to follow. Black-box systems are becoming more and more prevalent in the radiation oncology setting. For example, true black-box systems in the form of machine learning (ML) algorithms are already widely used within common treatment planning systems (TPS). These systems present a unique challenge to the QMP who is responsible for conducting independent V\&V performance measurements on such systems. Although these systems require a different approach from classic treatment delivery systems, we present new terms for characterizing black-box systems and a methodology for using alternative methods of independent validation.},

abstract = {Abstract Purpose The purpose of this guideline is to provide a list of critical performance tests in order to assist the Qualified Medical Physicist (QMP) in establishing and maintaining a safe and effective quality assurance (QA) program. The performance tests on a linear accelerator (linac) should be selected to fit the clinical patterns of use of the accelerator and care should be given to perform tests which are relevant to detecting errors related to the specific use of the accelerator. Methods A risk assessment was performed on tests from current task group reports on linac QA to highlight those tests that are most effective at maintaining safety and quality for the patient. Recommendations are made on the acquisition of reference or baseline data, the establishment of machine isocenter on a routine basis, basing performance tests on clinical use of the linac, working with vendors to establish QA tests and performing tests after maintenance. Results The recommended tests proposed in this guideline were chosen based on the results from the risk analysis and the consensus of the guideline's committee. The tests are grouped together by class of test (e.g., dosimetry, mechanical, etc.) and clinical parameter tested. Implementation notes are included for each test so that the QMP can understand the overall goal of each test. Conclusion This guideline will assist the QMP in developing a comprehensive QA program for linacs in the external beam radiation therapy setting. The committee sought to prioritize tests by their implication on quality and patient safety. The QMP is ultimately responsible for implementing appropriate tests. In the spirit of the report from American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 100, individual institutions are encouraged to analyze the risks involved in their own clinical practice and determine which performance tests are relevant in their own radiotherapy clinics.},
