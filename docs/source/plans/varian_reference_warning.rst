   This method is intended to approximate Varian-provided reference plans.
   Exact replication is **not guaranteed**.

   Small discrepancies may occur in one or more axes (e.g., gantry,
   collimator, couch, jaw, or MLC positions) due to rounding, or limitations in what
   can be customized by the PlanGenerator.
