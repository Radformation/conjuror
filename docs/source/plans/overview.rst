Plan Generator
--------------

The Plan Generator enables users to create custom RT DICOM plans specifically
designed for machine quality assurance (QA) workflows. The Plan Generator
provides a flexible feature set that allows it to operate as a standalone
tool or within RadMachine.

.. danger::

   The RT Plans generated by this library are intended exclusively for machine
   Quality Assurance (QA) on Varian TrueBeam and Halcyon systems. These plans
   are not clinical and must never be used for patient treatment or delivered
   on patients under any circumstances.

   Use of this software is restricted to non-clinical testing, research, or
   development purposes only.


DICOM RT Plan IOD
-----------------

The RT plans created by this tool follow the DICOM RT plan IOD:

`DICOM RT Plan IOD <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html#sect_A.20>`__


System Compatibility
--------------------

The generated RT plans adhere to system-specific DICOM tag structures known
to these Varian platforms.

Definitions
-----------

The Plan Generator operates using the following core entities and their
relationships:

* **Beam** - Represents a DICOM RT Beam. A Beam contains all information
  defining the Control Point Sequence of an external radiation beam.

* **Procedure** - Represents a logical grouping of Beams based on
  domain-specific use cases. Although Procedure is not a DICOM-standard entity,
  it facilitates the creation of QA tests. For example, a Winston–Lutz
  procedure may include multiple Beams, each corresponding to a unique
  combination of gantry, collimator, and couch positions.

* **Plan** - Represents a DICOM RT Plan that encompasses all Beams across all
  Procedures. Since Procedure is not part of the DICOM hierarchy, Beams in a
  Plan are stored as a sequential, ungrouped list. Per DICOM standard it also
  contains the information about the patient and other metadata.
